# 📘 CSC‑Assignments‑NorcoCollege

This repository serves as a **comprehensive archive of past coding assignments** completed for Norco College’s Computer Science courses. It is designed as both a personal portfolio of work and a practical reference for understanding how to approach common programming problems in C++, Python, and other languages used throughout the curriculum.

## 🎯 Purpose
- To **document and preserve** solutions to course assignments for future study and review.  
- To provide a **structured learning resource** that demonstrates problem‑solving strategies, debugging methods, and formatting precision required by automated graders.  
- To act as a **foundation for growth**, where earlier solutions can be revisited, refactored, and improved as programming skills advance.  

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **Assignment Folders**: Each assignment is organized into its own directory, typically named after the course module or project.  
- **Source Code Files**: Written primarily in **C++**, with some assignments in **Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** depending on the course requirements.  
- **README Notes**: Contextual explanations, problem statements, and reflections on challenges faced and solutions applied.  
- **Formatting Precision**: Special attention is given to **tabs, spaces, and output formatting**, ensuring compatibility with automated grading systems.  

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Exact Output Matching**: Solutions are refined to pass strict grading scripts, including invisible formatting quirks.  
- **Troubleshooting Logs**: Many assignments include notes on debugging strategies, compiler configuration, and system path adjustments.  
- **Reusable Code Patterns**: Common algorithms (matrix operations, loops, conditionals, file I/O) are implemented in ways that can be adapted for future projects.  
- **Educational Value**: The repository doubles as a **study guide**, showing step‑by‑step approaches to solving problems.  

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated
- Proficiency in **C++**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**  
- **Systematic debugging** and troubleshooting of compiler/environment issues  
- **Version control discipline** through GitHub commits and updates  
- **Analytical thinking** in breaking down assignments into smaller, testable components  

## 📈 Future Directions
- Expanding the repository with **new coursework** and **personal projects**.  
- Adding **unit tests** to validate solutions beyond automated graders.  
- Refactoring older code to reflect **improved coding standards** and **best practices**.  
- Enhancing documentation with **diagrams, flowcharts, and explanations** for complex logic.
